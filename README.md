# piSingleSwitchRadio
Ingredients:
- **Raspberry Pi** (developed and tested on Pi 1 B+ model, should work flawlessly on the newer models),
- **Hi-Fi set** or boombox or whatever that could play music,
- **switch** (eg. from an old PC case),
- **cable** to connect RPi and Hi-Fi set,
- **piSingleSwithRadio.py** and **piSingleSwithRadio.json** files (preferable in your home directory - mostly /home/pi).

##### It could be one of the easiest projects using GPIO pin!

## Let's do some tinkering...

### 1. Connect switch to the Raspberry Pi

## Configuring environment
Following script runs **only on Raspberry Pi**. It also requires *mpv* and *espeak* packages. Install it by following commands:
```sh
$ sudo apt install mpv
$ sudo apt install espeak
```
